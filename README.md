Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

### What was the theme you chose?
#### I made an app that showed images and tweets related to potatos. I think it was something everyone could agree is a great thing

### How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?
#### using a search term variable, it is passed into the API calls to get returns related to potatos. For Getty calls, I ensured the images where royalty free and were free of adult content

### What are known problems, if any, with your project?
#### currently, calls for tweets are limited to 100, due to how the Twitter API limits the number of returned elements

### How would you improve it if you had more time?
#### I'd like to add a text box to enable changing the theme from the search, and enable multi term searches
