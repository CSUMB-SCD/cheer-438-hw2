# Harlan Cheer, Potatweet
## The next step in potato-tweet technologies

This repo is for Harlan Cheer's cst 438 homework 2, which involves making calls to multiple APIs, Twitter and Getty Images, to display images and tweets in relation to potatos. Using Oauth 2.0 for Twitter, to gain access to status posts from twitter. 

## Some Questions:


### What was the theme you chose?
#### I made an app that showed images and tweets related to potatos. I think it was something everyone could agree is a great thing

### How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?
#### using a search term variable, it is passed into the API calls to get returns related to potatos. For Getty calls, I ensured the images where royalty free and were free of adult content

### What are known problems, if any, with your project?
#### currently, calls for tweets are limited to 100, due to how the Twitter API limits the number of returned elements

### How would you improve it if you had more time?
#### I'd like to add a text box to enable changing the theme from the search, and enable multi term searches
